Comprehensive Specification for Serial Trigger Test App

1. Overview

This app is designed to send serial triggers to a recording machine via a USB-to-serial adapter. Upon launch, it will begin sending an increasing sequence of triggers (from 1 to 256) at a rate of one trigger per second. The app will display the trigger count along with both wall time and internal app time. If the serial connection is lost, the app will display a warning and stop sending triggers until the connection is re-established, at which point it will restart the trigger sequence from 1.

2. System Requirements
   •	Platform: Android or Desktop (based on the specific environment)
   •	Connection Type: USB-to-serial adapter
   •	Serial Configuration:
   •	Baud Rate: 9600
   •	Data Type: uInt8 (unsigned 8-bit integer)
   •	Port: Automatically detected (only one connection will be present)
   •	App UI: Text-based display with status messages
   •	Error Handling: Error messages for connection failures and incorrect configuration
   •	Trigger Timing: One trigger per second

3. Key Functional Requirements

Serial Communication
•	The app will automatically detect the first available USB-to-serial port.
•	If the serial port is successfully detected, the app will configure the port with a baud rate of 9600.
•	Once connected, the app will begin sending an increasing sequence of serial triggers (1-256) every second.
•	The app will show the serial port name on the screen.
•	If the serial connection fails at any point:
•	The app will stop sending triggers.
•	An error message will be displayed, suggesting that the user check the connection and configuration.
•	The app will automatically retry to connect to the serial port.
•	If the serial connection is re-established after failure, the app will restart the trigger sequence from 1.

Trigger Sequence
•	Triggers will be sent in increasing order from 1 to 256, with a 1-second delay between each trigger.
•	After 256, the sequence will restart from 1.
•	The app will display:
•	Wall Time: Absolute time when the trigger is sent (e.g., 14:30:12.345).
•	Internal App Time: The time since the app started (e.g., 12.345s since start).
•	The app will start sending triggers automatically when launched.

User Interface (UI)
•	Status Display: Simple text-based display showing:
•	The current trigger number
•	The wall time and internal app time for the current trigger
•	The serial port name that is being used for the connection
•	Status Messages: Displayed messages to indicate key states:
•	“Starting…”: When the app launches and begins initializing.
•	“Waiting for connection…”: When the app is waiting to detect the serial connection.
•	“Connection established”: When the serial port is successfully connected.
•	“Error: Connection lost”: If the serial connection is lost.
•	The app will run in a standard window (not fullscreen).

Exit Behavior
•	The app will run continuously and only stop when manually closed by the user.

4. Error Handling

Serial Connection Errors
•	Initial Connection Failure: If no serial connection is found, the app will display a message such as “Error: No serial device found” and will retry the connection automatically.
•	Configuration Errors: If the serial port configuration is incorrect (e.g., wrong baud rate), the app will display an error message such as “Error: Invalid configuration. Please check baud rate and try again.”
•	Connection Loss: If the connection is lost during operation:
•	The app will display a warning message like “Error: Connection lost.”
•	It will stop sending triggers and automatically attempt to reconnect.
•	If the connection is restored, the app will restart the trigger sequence from 1.

Retry Logic
•	Automatic Retry: After a connection failure, the app will retry connecting every 5 seconds until successful.

5. Architecture and Design

App Flow
1.	Launch: The app will start, display a “Starting…” message, and begin attempting to detect the serial port.
2.	Serial Detection: Once the serial port is detected, the app will configure the port and display the serial port name.
3.	Trigger Sending: The app will begin sending triggers (1-256) at 1-second intervals, displaying timestamps on the screen.
4.	Error Handling: If the serial connection is lost, the app will show an error message and stop sending triggers until reconnected.
5.	Shutdown: The app will continue running until manually closed by the user.

Serial Communication Details
•	The app will use a USB-to-serial adapter, configured with a baud rate of 9600.
•	The app will send uInt8 (unsigned 8-bit integer) values, which will be sent one at a time every second.
•	Purge Logic: The app will purge the buffer before and after sending each trigger, ensuring there is no leftover data in the serial port buffer.

6. Testing Plan

1. Initial Setup Test
   •	Objective: Verify that the app detects the serial port correctly and connects without issues.
   •	Steps:
   •	Connect the USB-to-serial adapter.
   •	Launch the app.
   •	Ensure the app displays the correct serial port name on the screen.
   •	Check that the app starts sending triggers.

2. Trigger Sequence Test
   •	Objective: Ensure that the app sends triggers from 1 to 256, with a 1-second interval.
   •	Steps:
   •	Monitor the display to ensure the trigger count increases from 1 to 256.
   •	Confirm that after 256, the sequence restarts from 1.
   •	Verify the accuracy of wall time and internal app time for each trigger.

3. Connection Loss and Recovery Test
   •	Objective: Test the app’s behavior when the serial connection is lost and re-established.
   •	Steps:
   •	Disconnect the serial device during operation.
   •	Ensure the app stops sending triggers and displays a warning.
   •	Reconnect the serial device and verify that the app restarts the trigger sequence from 1.

4. Error Handling Test
   •	Objective: Test the app’s response to incorrect serial configuration.
   •	Steps:
   •	Manually set the wrong baud rate or port settings.
   •	Launch the app and verify that it shows an error message indicating the issue and suggests the correct configuration.

5. Continuous Operation Test
   •	Objective: Verify the app’s stability during continuous operation.
   •	Steps:
   •	Run the app for an extended period (several hours) and monitor for any issues (e.g., crashes or performance degradation).
   •	Ensure the app does not stop sending triggers unless manually closed.

7. Developer Notes
   •	Platform-Specific Requirements: Ensure compatibility with the chosen platform (e.g., Android or Desktop).
   •	UI Framework: Use a simple text-based UI, which can be built using Android’s TextView or a basic desktop GUI framework.
   •	Serial Communication Library: Utilize existing libraries for serial communication (e.g., javax.comm or RxTx on desktop, or UsbSerial on Android).
   •	Time Handling: Use standard time libraries to handle both wall time and internal app time.
